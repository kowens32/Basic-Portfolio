      <p> Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kimberly Owens and and here are a few things about me:
       <li> I like Pina Coladas </li>
       <li> And getting caught in the rain </li>
		<li> I'm not into yoga </li>
		<li> a strong case could be made that I have half a brain </li>

</p>
 <p>
	Other than that, I enjoy long walks on the beach and clapping for pilots when they land the airplane after a long flight!
	</p>

<p> 
...Are you still there? Okay good.
		My name is Kimberly Owens and I am a 2015 graduate of Elon University.
	Upon graduation I became the Manager of US Southeast Territory at a tech startup in Raleigh, NC and in April 2016 I completed my CAPM certification
	(Certified Associate in Project Management). In June of 2016 I  moved to Investor Relations for a private equity firm in Dallas, TX.
	I have decided to return back to technology because I want to be in an enviroment
	where I am pushed to be constantly growing and learning.</p></div>
