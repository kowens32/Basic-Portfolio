      <p> Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kimberly Owens and and here are a few things about me:
       <li> I like Pina Coladas </li>
       <li> And getting caught in the rain </li>
		<li> I'm not into yoga </li>
		<li> a strong case could be made that I have half a brain </li>
</p>
<p>
	Other than that, I enjoy long walks on the beach and clapping for pilots when they land the airplane after a long flight!
	</p>

<p> 
(Are you still there? Okay good.) My name is Kimberly Owens and I am a 2015 graduate of Elon University. I was Manager of US Southeast Territory at a tech startup in Raleigh, NC and then moved to Investor Relations for a PE Firm in Dallas, TX. I have completed my CAPM Certification (Certified Associate in Project Management) in April 2016. I have decided to return back to technology because I want to be in an enviroment where I am pushed to be constantly growing and learning. </p>
